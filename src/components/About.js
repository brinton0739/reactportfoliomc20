        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Brinton Cole and this is my coding portfolio. I have over 15 years of experience in managing people, software, and software companies to succeed in sales
, relationships, and revenue growth. This is my first attempt at writing the code! This site provides links to some of the highlights of my work from a rigorous coding boot camp at the University of Utah.
Outside of this bootcamp I have a bachelorâ€™s in business management from Utah Valley University.</p>
